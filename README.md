# **SSEconomySimulator**

## **The objective of this project**
Economics can be hard to understand without the basic knowledge of the early, key principles that you are taught.
These key principles include how Fiscal, Monetary and Supply Side policies impact the economy.
The objective of this system is to give users, mainly students, the ability to control Government policies
and more to see how their decisions effect the economy, and overall helping them to grasp a better understanding
of early Economics.

## **Basic idea about my implementation**
The code is in files, named Stage 1 - Stage 4.
These stages contain the code based on the stage of the game the user is in.
Stage 1 contains the login and registration pages, 2 contains the policies, 3 contains the tutorial and 4 contains
everything required for the simulation.

## **Final thoughts on the project**
Python was used as this was one of my earlier projects, where this was the main language I was learning.
The code could arguably need re-writing as this was one of my earlier large projects.
Java could be better suited for this project, especially for the GUI.
